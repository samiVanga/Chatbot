## How It Works

### Preprocessing
- Tokenisation, lemmatisation, stop-word removal, and sentiment analysis using `nltk`.

### Intent Matching
- Uses **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity**.
- Modular datasets for each feature (e.g., `SmallTalk.csv`, `IdentityManagement.csv`).
- Easily extendable by adding new datasets.

### Booking System
- Persistent storage with **SQLite**
- Tracks incomplete/resumed bookings
- Validates:
  - Dates (within 90 days)
  - Times (11am‚Äì11pm)
  - Party size (< 20 people)
